# Awesome Shooter Game

This is my first PyGame project. It's a simple shooter game where you control a
fighter spaceship and try to shoot down aliens.

## Gameplay

- Use the arrow keys to move the rectangle:
    - Up arrow: Move the rectangle up.
    - Down arrow: Move the rectangle down.
    - Left arrow: Move the rectangle left.
    - Right arrow: Move the rectangle right.
- The rectangle is bounded by the edges of the screen, so it cannot move beyond
  the screen boundaries.
